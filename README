|| HIVEMIND/HIDDEN MODE ||
==========================

HIVE MIND mode will connect your client to an IRC server so it can be controlled
remotely. Think of it like a voluntary botnet. They might even make your client
do naughty things, so beware.

Note: It does NOT allow remote administration of your machine, or anything shit
like that, it is literally just control of loic itself.

If you want to start up in hivemind, run like this:
 LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address
It will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/LOIC

You can also specify port and channel
 LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address 1234 #secret
It will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:1234/secret

In order to do hivemind hidden run like this:
 LOIC.exe /hidden /hivemind irc.server.address
It will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/LOIC without any visible GUI
