===================
|| HIVEMIND MODE ||
===================

HIVE MIND mode will connect your client to an IRC server so it can be controlled
remotely. Think of it like a voluntary botnet. They might even make your client
do naughty things, so beware.

Note: It does NOT allow remote administration of your machine, or anything shit
like that, it is literally just control of loic itself.

If you want to start up in hivemind, run like this:

LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address

It will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/LOIC

=================
|| HIDDEN MODE ||
=================

If you want to start up hidden, run like this:

LOIC.exe /hidden targetip=127.0.0.1 method=tcp random=false

Look in frmMain.cs for void CheckParams(List pars) if you need more info
